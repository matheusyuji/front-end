  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ¼ cups Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
    <li>1 (4 inch) piece konbu dried kelp (Optional)</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place rice into a large, deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice 
      together with hands until water turns milky white. Pour off cloudy water, 
      being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat 3 or 4 times until you can see 
      rice through 3 inches of water.
    </li>
    <li>Drain rice in a fine strainer, then place into a saucepan along with konbu
      and 3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Stir together rice vinegar,
      sugar, and salt until dissolved in a small bowl; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and
      simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard konbu. Stir in vinegar mixture until well
      incorporated and no lumps of rice remain. Allow to cool at room temperature. For a shinier
      appearance, use an electric fan to cool rice rapidly.
    </li>
  </ol>
