  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Consider this a gateway paella and the first step to a serious, lifelong addiction.
    When I first do a version of a classic dish like paella, I try to use a minimum number
    of ingredients and steps to focus on technique. After learning the method, you'll
    ideally use a wider variety of ingredients, like clams, mussels, squid, and chicken,
    which will make your rice that much more interesting. Garnish with extra virgin olive
    oil, freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley, and lemon wedges.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined, shells reserved</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon saffron threads, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>8 ounces chorizo sausage, sliced into thin rounds</li>
    <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ⅓ cups Arborio rice</li>
    <li>½ cup green peas</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook and stir reserved shrimp shells and 2 teaspoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium
      heat until shells are pink and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir saffron into shells; add chicken
      broth, bring to a simmer, and cook until broth is a rusty brown and fragrant, about 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Strain saffron broth through a fine-mesh sieve; measure out 2 cups of broth, pour into a small
      saucepan, and place over low heat to keep broth hot.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Cook chorizo slices
      in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add onion to sausage; cook and stir until soft
      and slightly translucent, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
    </li>
    <li>Stir garlic into chorizo mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice to skillet
      and stir to coat rice completely in oil; stir in peas.
    </li>
    <li>Pat rice mixture evenly into the bottom of the skillet. Arrange shrimp in a single layer over the
      top of the rice. Lay pepper strips around and in between shrimp; season with salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Increase heat to high. When rice begins to sizzle in the skillet, pour reserved 2 cups hot saffron broth
      over the shrimp; gently shake the skillet to distribute liquid.
    </li>
    <li>Bake rice mixture in the preheated oven until rice is almost tender and still a bit wet, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place skillet over medium-high and cook until rice is tender, liquid is absorbed, and rice caramelizes and
       crusts slightly on the bottom of the skillet, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
